# Student-Information-Desk

The Student Information Desk (SID) aims to help students make the very best of their time at LNMIIT by providing information and enquiry service which is accessible to all students.  SID is similar to the MIS portal that is currently being used by the students. The difference is that SID will be flexible, easy to use and includes all the information at one place. Also, SID will be mobile responsive which makes it easier for the students to access the website on mobile phones too.
